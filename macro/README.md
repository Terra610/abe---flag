# A.B.E. Macroeconomic Cascade Model  
**Nation-scale projections from one restored community.**

The Macro Model takes the recovery value from a single community — the “Restored Community Unit” — and scales it to any number of communities nationwide.  
It’s the high-altitude view of what systemic constitutional fidelity does to the economy at scale.

If CIRI shows what one county gets back, the Macro Model shows what America gets back.

# 🔥 What This Module Does  
- Loads the macro model JSON (`ABE_MacroCascadeModel.json`)
- Uses multipliers (GDP, wages, spending)
- Computes:
  - direct investment per community  
  - jobs created  
  - citizens served  
  - recurring savings  
- Projects:
  - total GDP uplift  
  - wage uplift  
  - local spending uplift  
  - annual recurring savings  
- Draws three live bar charts (GDP, wages, spending)
- Lets visitors:
  - adjust the number of communities  
  - download a scenario CSV  
  - run analyses with their own uploaded CIRI data (if present)

# 🔥 Constitutional Purpose  
When rights are violated at scale, the harm is not anecdotal — it’s national.  
Thousands of jurisdictions misapplying statutes add up to **billions in lost GDP, wages, and public wealth**.

The Macro Model demonstrates a simple truth:

> **If the Constitution is followed everywhere, prosperity compounds everywhere.**

This module shows how restoring fidelity in even one county ripples outward into jobs, spending, health, justice, and national economic strength.

# 🦋 How It Connects  
- CIRI determines the per-community recovery value  
- Macro multiplies that value across counties, districts, or entire states  
- The charts show:
  - per-community effect  
  - scenario-wide effect  

Visitors can run:  
**100 communities → 1,000 → 10,000 → national cascade.**

# 🧩 Files  - 2.4× GDP  
  - 1.8× wages  
  - 2.0× local spending  
- **Macro impact:**  
  - \$3.3T–\$3.9T annual U.S. GDP uplift  
  - \$7T–\$10T global uplift  
  - \$95B–\$175B current federal civil exposure (False Claims Act treble: \$285B–\$525B)

## How to use this in a boardroom
1. **Risk:** Show leaders they are already exposed to unconstitutional practices that carry federal liability and False Claims Act risk.
2. **Relief:** Show that A.B.E. is a lawful off-ramp that stabilizes budgets instead of detonating them.
3. **Growth:** Show that community repair is not "loss"; it’s recurring GDP and workforce expansion.
4. **Timeline:** 2-year implementation window (2026–2027) for meaningful statewide stabilization.

## Where the numbers live
- The structured model is in [`model.json`](./model.json).  
- The public-facing translation for executives and communities is [`index.html`](./index.html).

## How this links to the rest of A.B.E.
- [`../ciri/`](../ciri/index.html) calculates the local dollar value of prevented harm and restored rights.
- [`../cibs/`](../cibs/index.html) allocates that value into housing, mobility, mental health, defense, and stability.
- [`../system/`](../system/index.html) maps the flow of obligation and money so leaders can't bury it.
- [`../integration/`](../integration/index.html) is the escalation layer when anyone tries to interfere.
- [`../doctrine/`](../doctrine/index.html) is the constitutional, civil, and human rights authority for all of this.

## What you are looking at
This is Restoration Economics.  
It is built to end extraction-based governance and replace it with lawful reinvestment in the people who were targeted.
