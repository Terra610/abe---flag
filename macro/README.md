## What this is
This model shows how repairing one community — lawfully, economically, constitutionally — scales into statewide and national recovery.

It is not charity. It is recovery of value that was already being burned through unconstitutional enforcement, retaliatory fines, coerced poverty, blocked mobility, and preventable incarceration.

## Core mechanics
- **Investment per site:** \$10M–\$25M  
- **Citizens directly served:** 3,500–5,600  
- **Jobs created:** ~550 @ \$42K average salary  
- **Annual recurring ROI:** 1.5×–3.0× and compounding  
- **Direct cost avoidance:**  
  - \$6.0M/yr less in criminal justice system burn  
  - \$4.2M/yr less in emergency / crisis medical burn  
- **Economic multipliers:**  
  - 2.4× GDP  
  - 1.8× wages  
  - 2.0× local spending  
- **Macro impact:**  
  - \$3.3T–\$3.9T annual U.S. GDP uplift  
  - \$7T–\$10T global uplift  
  - \$95B–\$175B current federal civil exposure (False Claims Act treble: \$285B–\$525B)

## How to use this in a boardroom
1. **Risk:** Show leaders they are already exposed to unconstitutional practices that carry federal liability and False Claims Act risk.
2. **Relief:** Show that A.B.E. is a lawful off-ramp that stabilizes budgets instead of detonating them.
3. **Growth:** Show that community repair is not "loss"; it’s recurring GDP and workforce expansion.
4. **Timeline:** 2-year implementation window (2026–2027) for meaningful statewide stabilization.

## Where the numbers live
- The structured model is in [`model.json`](./model.json).  
- The public-facing translation for executives and communities is [`index.html`](./index.html).

## How this links to the rest of A.B.E.
- [`../ciri/`](../ciri/index.html) calculates the local dollar value of prevented harm and restored rights.
- [`../cibs/`](../cibs/index.html) allocates that value into housing, mobility, mental health, defense, and stability.
- [`../system/`](../system/index.html) maps the flow of obligation and money so leaders can't bury it.
- [`../integration/`](../integration/index.html) is the escalation layer when anyone tries to interfere.
- [`../doctrine/`](../doctrine/index.html) is the constitutional, civil, and human rights authority for all of this.

## What you are looking at
This is Restoration Economics.  
It is built to end extraction-based governance and replace it with lawful reinvestment in the people who were targeted.
