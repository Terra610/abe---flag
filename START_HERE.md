# 🦋 Welcome to The American Butterfly Effect (A.B.E.)
**A constitutional and economic restoration engine — free, public, auditable, and impossible to monopolize.**

If you’re here, it’s probably because something in the system feels off —  
whether it’s unlawful detention, misapplied statutes, impossible fines, civil-rights bleed, or watching your community lose money and opportunity for no good reason.

A.B.E. exists to show the truth in numbers:
**what overreach costs, what fidelity restores, and how communities rise when the Constitution is actually followed.**

Everything runs **locally in your browser**.  
No tracking. No data harvesting. No server.  
Your uploads never leave your device.

# 🌐 What A.B.E. Actually *Is*
A.B.E. is a modular, public-good engine built to turn constitutional alignment into economic clarity.

It’s made of:

- **CAE** — Constitutional Alignment Engine (legal scope & authority)
- **CDI** — Divergence Index (0–1 signal of misalignment)
- **CIRI** — Integrity ROI Engine (recovery dollars from correction)
- **CIBS** — Budget allocator for public reinvestment
- **CII** — Portfolio builder (projects your community can actually buy)
- **Macro** — Nation-scale projections
- **Integration** — Audit receipts & SHA-256 hashing
- **System Map** — Chain-of-custody of the entire engine

This is not theory.  
This is receipts.

# 🔥 Why This Matters
When the government acts outside constitutional limits — even by a little — the economic fallout is not small.  
It spreads across:

- detention  
- fees & fines  
- employment  
- health  
- local spending  
- courts  
- civil rights

A.B.E. shows the cost of divergence **and the value of fixing it**.

This gives communities, attorneys, policymakers, and citizens something they’ve never had before:

> **A measurable, court-ready, data-grounded way to prove what constitutional overreach really costs.**

# 🧠 How to Use A.B.E. (5-Minute Guide)

## 1. **Start with CIRI**
Go here:  
`/ciri/index.html`

Upload your own CSV (or use the default).  
CIRI calculates:

- Total Recovery  
- CIRI Index  
- ROI per case  
- Breakdown of all components  
- A downloadable recovery report  
- A PDF receipt (optional)  
- A scenario CSV (`ABE_CIRI_SCENARIO_V2.csv`)

Everything runs locally.  
Your file never leaves your machine.

---

## 2. **See What Recovery Becomes (CIBS → CII)**
- CIBS allocates recovered dollars into categories (housing, clinics, mobility, etc.)
- CII shows real projects your community could build with that value

These two pages show what recovery looks like **on the ground**.

---

## 3. **Scale It (Macro Model)**
Want to know what happens if 100 communities fix the same constitutional failure?  
Or 1,000?  
Or the nation?

The Macro Model shows:

- GDP uplift  
- wage uplift  
- local spending growth  
- jobs  
- recurring savings

All based on the same local truth.

---

## 4. **Verify Everything (Integration Layer)**
Integration recomputes, cross-checks, and hashes:

- CIRI  
- CIBS  
- CDI  
- CAE

It generates an **audit certificate** with SHA-256 hashes.

This is your **court-ready receipt** that no one altered the data.

---

## 5. **Explore the Laws & Patterns (CAE → CDI)**
- CAE exposes the legal misalignment (statutes, CFR, scope)
- CDI quantifies the divergence (0–1 score)

These modules show the “why” behind the dollars.

---

# 🛡️ Privacy & Integrity
A.B.E. is designed to protect people from both overreach and exploitation.

- 100% client-side  
- no servers  
- no logs  
- no tracking  
- no hidden analytics  
- no upload storage  

Your data belongs to *you*, not to A.B.E.

---

# 🧬 Philosophical Core (The Terra Clause)
A.B.E. is built on a simple belief:

> **No one is above the law, and no one is beneath dignity.  
> Prosperity begins with fidelity.**

A system that follows the Constitution thrives.  
A system that drifts from it bleeds — economically, socially, morally.

A.B.E. quantifies that truth.
