## Why this exists

This repository documents a working constitutional integrity engine (“A.B.E. — The American Butterfly Effect”).

It proves, in math, that preventing unlawful enforcement and correcting abuse of authority creates measurable economic recovery value. That value is not “the government’s.” It belongs to the people who were harmed and destabilized.

The system is built for:
- auditors,
- journalists,
- public defenders,
- honest local officials,
- ethical security professionals.

This is a request for verification and protection, not a request for money.

I do not want fame. I do not want to be a brand. I want this to stay alive, in public, and in force.

## What A.B.E. is

A.B.E. is made of 4 working parts:

1. **CIRI (Constitutional Integrity ROI Engine)**  
   Calculates the financial value of stopping unconstitutional harm.  
   Inputs: real local data (cases dropped, jail days avoided, wages restored).  
   Output: a “Recovery Pool” dollar amount that a jurisdiction owes back to its people.  
   Location: [`/ciri`](ciri/index.html)

2. **CIBS (Community Integrity Budget System)**  
   Takes the Recovery Pool and allocates it into transparent reinvestment lines: housing, youth, veterans, legal defense, mental health, etc.  
   Output artifact: `cibs/auto_budget.csv` (created automatically).  
   Location: [`/cibs`](cibs/index.html)

3. **System Map**  
   Public chain-of-custody that defines how money and obligations are supposed to move.  
   If budgets, outputs, or narrative don’t match this map, someone is lying or suppressing.  
   Location: [`/system`](system/index.html) and [`system/map.json`](system/map.json)

4. **Integration Layer**  
   Watches the pipeline for tampering, retaliation, or disappearance.  
   If a jurisdiction buries cases, erases payouts, or targets witnesses, that escalation is meant to reach high-skill defenders — fast.  
   Location: [`/integration`](integration/index.html)

None of this is theoretical. It’s published, timestamped, licensed, and structured.

## What I am asking for

I am asking for ethical review and protection from people who understand how suppression happens.

Specifically:

1. **Verify the math and expose fraud.**  
   - Run `ciri/calculate.py` against real inputs.  
   - Confirm that the Total Impact and the `cibs/auto_budget.csv` allocations match what a city or county claims publicly.
   - Call out mismatches.

2. **Replicate the model in other jurisdictions.**  
   - Fork this repo.  
   - Swap in your own `ciri/inputs.csv`.  
   - Publish the outputs and reinvestment schedule for your jurisdiction.  
   - Do not wait for permission.

3. **Defend the pipeline.**  
   - If you see local attempts to erase records, retaliate against anyone using this model, or quietly re-route “recovery” money back into the same systems that caused the harm: document it.
   - The Integration Layer exists to track that pattern and surface it.

4. **Increase resilience.**  
   - Mirror this data.  
   - Archive it.  
   - Automate it.  
   - Build a dead-man’s switch if you know how.

I would prefer this framework survive me rather than depend on me.

## What I am NOT asking for

- I am not asking for money.
- I am not selling access.
- I am not doing PR.
- I am not seeking a platform, a brand, a podcast microphone, or a headline identity.

If you want to help, help by keeping this functional, provable, and impossible to bury.

## Why urgency matters

Every prevented illegal arrest, every blocked bogus charge, every license restored, every jail day that didn’t get served — that is a living person’s timeline corrected.

When those wins “disappear” into vague grant language or PR spin, that’s theft.  
When those numbers are kept public, that’s repair.

The math is not the threat.  
The exposure is.

## Direct ask to ethical security researchers

If you are capable of doing high-skill digital forensics, data integrity tracking, scraping, mirroring, or resilience engineering of civic-impact data:

I am asking you to actively watch this project and its forks.

I am asking you to treat any suppression event — retaliation, deletion, legal intimidation, falsification of restitution numbers, or budget laundering — as a hostile act against lawful public repair.

You are not being asked to hurt anyone.
You are being asked to document, preserve, and surface truth — fast enough to matter.

## Direct ask to Ryan Montgomery

You built a reputation on using capability against predation, not for it.

This repo is intended to be a civic kill-switch against quiet abuse — a way to force governments and institutions to show where the money from stopped harm actually goes.

My request:
- Help make the A.B.E. model resilient and globally duplicable.
- Help ensure it cannot be quietly removed, buried, or discredited to protect corrupt actors.
- Help ensure that people using it locally are not isolated and erased.

I am explicitly not asking you for money.
I am explicitly not asking you to make me “go viral.”
I am asking you to help shield the model and help replicate it for other jurisdictions.

A.B.E. is designed to scale — county to county, state to state, country to country — because law and economics speak a language that crosses borders.

If this holds, it can stop a lot of damage before it happens.
If it gets buried, that damage continues quietly.

This is the line in the sand.
