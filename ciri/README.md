# CIRI — Constitutional Integrity ROI Engine  
*(American Butterfly Effect — Recovery Computation Layer)*

### 🧭 Purpose
The **Constitutional Integrity ROI Engine (CIRI)** translates *legal realignment* into *economic and social recovery values*.  
Where **CAE** and **CDI** measure constitutional drift, **CIRI** answers the next question:

> “If we fix it, what happens to people, communities, and the economy?”

CIRI is the **mathematical bridge** between restored legality and restored prosperity.  
It proves that fidelity to constitutional law produces measurable gain — not just moral alignment.

### ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Input:**  
   - Reads `inputs.csv` — a structured dataset describing quantifiable effects of divergence (cases, costs, days detained, employment impacts, etc.).
   - References **CDI’s** current divergence to scale national recovery potential.

2. **Process:**  
   - Computes *recoverable economic value* by reversing the costs of divergence:
     - wrongful detentions  
     - coerced fees  
     - lost employment  
     - suppressed markets  
     - administrative inefficiencies  

3. **Output:**  
   - Produces *total recovery pool* value.  
   - Feeds that figure into **CIBS** (budget allocator).  
   - Generates **live KPIs** for CII (community-level implementation).

### 🧮 Default Inputs (`inputs.csv`)
Each row represents one measurable recovery vector.  

| Field | Description | Example |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| `cases_avoided` | Number of unlawful or unnecessary prosecutions prevented | `1240` |
| `avg_cost_per_case` | Typical cost per case (court + admin + defense) | `$5,200` |
| `jail_days_avoided` | Detention time eliminated by lawful compliance | `9,800` |
| `cost_per_jail_day` | Average incarceration cost per day | `$210` |
| `fees_canceled_total` | Total rescinded unlawful fines | `$480,000` |
| `households_restored` | Families restored to stability | `280` |
| `avg_monthly_market_spend` | Economic value per stable household per month | `$2,800` |
| `months_effective` | Recovery period in months | `12` |

### 💰 Recovery Calculation
CIRI sums these lawful restorations into one **Total Recovery Value**:

\[
R = (c*C + F) + (D*J) + (H*M*m) + ((H*pe)*W*m) + (P*E) - T
\]

Where each term corresponds to a form of *restored activity or cost prevention*, such as employment, spending, and litigation avoidance.

Each module’s equation can be tuned for region, sector, or population.

### 📊 Outputs
| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Total Recovery` | Aggregate lawful value restored |
| `Direct Case Savings` | Avoided prosecutorial and court cost |
| `Detention Savings` | Eliminated incarceration cost |
| `Employment Restoration` | Jobs regained through lawful compliance |
| `Household Spending` | Consumer and housing recovery impact |
| `Policy Efficiency Gain` | Fiscal and administrative savings |

### 🔗 Integration Path
| Flow | From | To |
|------|------|----|
| **Legal Basis** | CAE → CDI | Constitutional alignment scores |
| **Economic Model** | CIRI | Converts restored legality into financial metrics |
| **Budgeting** | CIBS | Allocates recovery pool funds by category |
| **Implementation** | CII | Tracks real-world community projects |
| **Audit** | Integration Layer | Verifies delivery and transparency |

---

### 🧠 Interpretation
CIRI shows the **economic gravity of justice**.  
When laws are aligned, coercive structures dissolve, and organic economic energy reappears — people work, build, buy, and heal.  
It’s the quantifiable proof that justice and prosperity are not separate forces.

---

### 🧩 Example Summary
| Metric | Value | Source |
|---------|--------|--------|
| CDI (Divergence) | 0.12 | `/cdi/index.html` |
| Average Alignment | 0.88 | `/cae/model.json` |
| Total Recovery | $12.4M | `/ciri/index.html` |

This data then becomes the **input pool** for CIBS to distribute as transparent community investment.

### 📎 Notes
- All calculations should remain **reproducible** — equations and CSV data are open.  
- No external dependencies: native JS only.  
- Every update should cite its input sources (e.g., DOJ budget, BJS data, or state-level justice stats).

### ✨ Ethos
> “The Constitution is not an expense — it’s the source of all profit.”  
> — *Terra Dawn Shouse*

By quantifying constitutional fidelity as an economic force, CIRI completes the A.B.E. feedback loop:  
**Alignment → Recovery → Reinvestment → Prosperity.**
