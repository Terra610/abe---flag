# ⚙️ CIRI — Constitutional Integrity ROI Engine

**What this is:**  
CIRI (Constitutional Integrity ROI Engine) is the accounting core of A.B.E.  
It calculates the *documented, lawful, provable* dollar impact of:
- Avoided wrongful prosecutions and incarcerations  
- Restored licenses / employability  
- Wages re-enabled for people who were illegally blocked from working  
- Lawsuit/restitution exposure that never has to be paid because the violation was prevented  
- Secondary community lift (local economic multiplier)

## How CIRI Works (High Level)

1. **Inputs**  
   We gather jurisdiction-level data (counts, costs, wages, etc.).
   You can see the placeholders here:  
   [`inputs.csv`](inputs.csv)

2. **Formulas / Math**  
   We apply those inputs to transparent calculations.
   Those formulas are documented here:  
   [`calc.md`](calc.md)

3. **Output**  
   We get a dollar amount that says:
   > "This is how much constitutional harm was *prevented or repaired*, in dollars."

That number becomes the lawful recovery value that can be routed into community repair,
**not** hidden, laundered, or quietly absorbed.

## Why This Matters

CIRI is what makes abuse of authority financially visible — in a way that auditors, attorneys,
policymakers, journalists, and civil society can all understand in plain math.

Every dollar that was *stolen from someone’s future* is either:
- prevented, or
- accounted for and put back in.

This is traceable. This is auditable. This is not for sale.

## Next Step in the Pipeline

CIRI feeds into **CIBS** (Community Integrity Budget System), which takes that recovery value and
turns it into **tracked reinvestment pools**: housing stability, mental health access,
legal defense & review, re-entry support, etc.
