## 🌍 Overview
**A.B.E.** (American Butterfly Effect) is a full-stack constitutional integrity and recovery model.  
It converts unlawful enforcement and constitutional divergence into measurable, auditable economic correction.

The project provides:
- **Foundational doctrines** — legal basis and restoration framework  
- **Economic engines** — CIRI, CIBS  
- **Transparency systems** — System Map, Integration Layer  
- **Public accountability tools** — for verifiable reform  

Together, these create a **lawful economic ecosystem** where recovery, reinvestment, and justice are tracked mathematically, not politically.

## 🧱 Repository Structure
This repository is organized into modular components that form the **American Butterfly Effect (A.B.E.)** constitutional recovery system.

## 🧭 How It Works

1. **CIRI** — Calculates *constitutional economic loss and recovery value* (prevented harm, overreach, or misallocation).  
2. **CIBS** — Converts that recovery into transparent, public reinvestment (housing, education, justice, etc.).  
3. **System Map** — Defines and monitors lawful data and fund flow; any deviation is traceable.  
4. **Integration Layer** — Detects tampering, suppression, or retaliation across systems.  
5. **CII (Citizen Impact Index)** — Quantifies local prosperity and social benefit post-alignment.  
6. **Doctrines** — Anchor all metrics in constitutional fidelity and civic ethics.

> The result: a **closed-loop constitutional economy** — measurable, auditable, and incorruptible.

## 🧮 Key Formula Models

| Symbol | Formula | Meaning |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **SIRF** | ΔI = (ΣL × Cf) / Rt | *Shouse Integrity Recovery Function* — measures total recoverable impact per constitutional fidelity factor |
| **IRE** | Rv = (Hₐ − Hₙ) × Eₜ | *Integrity Restoration Equation* — economic restoration from harm avoided or corrected |
| **CEQ** | η = (Eₐ / Eₘ) × 100 | *Civic Efficiency Quotient* — percentage of lawful efficiency regained in governance |
| **SIY** | Y = (Rv × Cf) / P | *Shouse Integrity Yield* — per capita recovery efficiency |
| **CDI** | δ = (ΣD / ΣC) × 100 | *Constitutional Divergence Index* — measures deviation from constitutional norms |
