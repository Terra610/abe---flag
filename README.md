# 🦋 The American Butterfly Effect (A.B.E.)
**A constitutional and economic restoration framework**  
_Transforming harm into measurable recovery through truth, math, and lawful governance._

---

## 🌍 Overview
**A.B.E.** (American Butterfly Effect) is a full-stack constitutional integrity and recovery model.  
It converts unlawful enforcement and constitutional divergence into measurable, auditable economic correction.

The project provides:
- **Foundational doctrines** (legal basis and restoration framework)
- **Economic engines** (CIRI, CIBS)
- **Transparency systems** (System Map, Integration Layer)
- **Public accountability tools** for verifiable reform

## 🧱 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into modular components that work together as a transparent, verifiable constitutional economy. Each folder represents a live subsystem within the American Butterfly Effect (A.B.E.) framework.

## 🧭 How It Works

1. **CIRI** – Calculates *constitutional economic loss and recovery value* based on misallocation, overreach, or deviation from constitutional mandates.  
2. **CIBS** – Allocates that recovery into public investments (housing, education, infrastructure, justice, etc.) using verified data models.  
3. **System Map** – Tracks the lawful flow of value and evidence across subsystems for audit readiness.  
4. **Integration Layer** – Verifies integrity, connects receipts and public attestations, and confirms all transactions remain lawful.  
5. **CII (Citizen Impact Index)** – Quantifies real-world outcomes from ABE/CRRA realignment, producing measurable improvements in citizen prosperity.  
6. **Doctrines** – Provide the legal and moral framework that defines the entire model, ensuring fidelity to constitutional principles.

Together, these components form a **closed-loop constitutional economy** that measures, audits, and restores prosperity lawfully — ensuring all reforms operate under *suprema lex terrae*, the supreme law of the land.
