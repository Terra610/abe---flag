# 🦋 Welcome to The American Butterfly Effect (A.B.E.)
**A constitutional and economic restoration engine — free, public, auditable, and impossible to monopolize.**

If you’re here, it’s probably because something in the system feels off —  
whether it’s unlawful detention, misapplied statutes, impossible fines, civil-rights bleed, funding games, or watching your community lose money and opportunity for no good reason.

A.B.E. exists to show the truth in numbers:
**what overreach costs, what fidelity restores, and how communities rise when the Constitution is actually followed.**

Everything runs **locally in your browser**.  
No tracking. No data harvesting. No server.  
Your uploads never leave your device.

# 🌐 What A.B.E. Actually *Is*
A.B.E. is a modular, public-good engine that turns constitutional alignment into economic clarity.

It’s made of:

- **CAE** — Constitutional Alignment Engine (legal scope & authority)
- **CDI** — Divergence Index (0–1 signal of misalignment)
- **CIRI** — Constitutional Integrity ROI Engine (recovery dollars from correction)
- **CIBS** — Integrity Baseline Schema (how recovery becomes a public budget)
- **CII** — Community Investment Interface (projects your community can actually buy)
- **CFF** — Constitutional Funding Forensics (on-mission vs off-mission federal spend)
- **AFFE** — American Funding & Fidelity Explorer (deep dive into funding patterns)
- **CCRI** — Consumer Credit Risk Integrity (how credit systems use lawful vs unlawful data)
- **Macro** — Macroeconomic Cascade (nation-scale projections)
- **Integration** — Audit receipts & SHA-256 hashing
- **System Map** — Chain-of-custody of the entire engine

This is not theory.  
This is receipts.

# 🔥 Why This Matters
When the government acts outside constitutional limits — even by a little — the fallout is not small.  
It spreads across:

- detention  
- fees & fines  
- employment  
- health  
- housing  
- credit & vehicles  
- local spending  
- courts  
- civil rights

A.B.E. shows the **cost of divergence** and the **value of fixing it**.

That gives communities, attorneys, policymakers, oversight teams, lenders, and citizens something they’ve never had before:

> **A measurable, court-ready, data-grounded way to prove what constitutional overreach really costs — and what fidelity returns.**

# 🧠 How to Use A.B.E. (5-Minute Guide)

## 1. **If you’re dealing with detention, tickets, or court abuse → start with CIRI**

Go here:  
`/ciri/index.html`

On the page:

1. Download `inputs.csv` (the template).
2. Fill it with your case or county/state data  
   (cases avoided, jail days, fees, threatened lawsuits, household impact, etc.).
3. Upload it back into the CIRI page.
4. Review the live breakdown and download your **Constitutional Recovery Receipt**  
   (plus a scenario CSV like `ABE_CIRI_SCENARIO_V2.csv`).

CIRI calculates:

- total recovery  
- CIRI index  
- ROI per case  
- breakdown of direct, detention, enforcement, market, employment, litigation, transition

All of it runs **locally in your browser**.

---

## 2. **If you want to see where the recovered dollars go → CIBS + CII**

- **CIBS** (`/cibs/index.html`) takes the CIRI recovery pool and allocates it into:
  - housing
  - clinics
  - food & nutrition
  - mobility & transit
  - workforce & education
  - justice repair
- **CII** (`/cii/index.html`) turns those allocations into auditable project portfolios:
  - project lists
  - per-category totals
  - a view you can hand to a mayor, council, or community board

You’re not just seeing “big numbers.”  
You’re seeing **what your community could actually build.**

---

## 3. **If you care about credit access, vehicles, and banking barriers → CCRI**

Go here:  
`/ccri/index.html`

CCRI looks at **systems**, not people. It evaluates:

- which data sources a lender or dealer uses (credit bureau, DMV, DOT, background vendors)
- whether license status is used as a gatekeeper for credit
- how many non-commercial applicants get denied because of DMV/DOT-driven rules
- whether there’s any appeal or human review path

You define scenarios in `ccri/inputs.json` and CCRI:

- scores **data integrity**, **constitutional alignment**, **access fairness**, and **economic impact**
- flags DMV/DOT misuse and license gating for non-commercial citizens
- produces an integrity score and narrative you can plug back into CIRI and CFF

It never scores people.  
It scores **practices** and **policies**.

## 4. **If you want to follow the money → CFF + AFFE**

- **CFF** (`/cff/index.html`) reads a funding CSV (like your MCSAP, Medicaid, TANF, ARPA, Title I, etc.) with:

  ```text
  ON_MISSION / OFF_MISSION / UNCLEAR
