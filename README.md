# 🦋 The American Butterfly Effect (A.B.E.)
**Constitutional & Economic Restoration Engine — Public, Auditable, Non-Commercial**

A.B.E. is a full-stack system built to do one thing with absolute clarity:  
**show what happens — economically, legally, and structurally — when a government follows the Constitution, and what it costs when it doesn’t.**

This project turns constitutional fidelity into measurable prosperity using a modular set of public, client-side tools:

- **CAE** — Constitutional Alignment Engine  
- **CDI** — Constitutional Divergence Index  
- **CIRI** — Constitutional Integrity ROI Engine  
- **CIBS** — Reinvestment/budget allocator  
- **CII** — Community investment portfolio builder  
- **Macro Model** — Nation-scale projections  
- **Integration Layer** — Receipts, verification, and hashing  
- **System Map** — Chain-of-custody for the entire engine

Everything is **browser-only**, **open**, and **non-commercial**.  
No servers. No data harvesting. No surveillance. No gatekeeping.

# ✨ What Problem This Solves  
America loses billions each year from one root failure:  
**misalignment between government actions and constitutional limits.**

Most people feel the harm (unlawful detention, fees, overreach, civil-rights bleed-out).  
A.B.E. is the first open framework that:

- exposes the systemic error,
- attaches a measurable dollar value to it,
- shows the repair value if fidelity is restored.

This is constitutional economics — not theory, not vibes — **math with receipts**.

---

# 🔥 Constitutional Purpose  
The Constitution isn’t an abstract philosophy. It’s the operating system of the country.  
When agencies or states wander off-script — especially by applying commercial codes to private citizens — **the divergence becomes measurable harm.**

A.B.E. quantifies that harm and shows the recovery unlocked when government returns to its lawful boundaries.

This is not anti-government.  
This is *pro-Constitution, pro-people, pro-integrity* governance.

# 📂 Project Structure  
Each module folder includes its own README explaining:

- What it does  
- How it works  
- How to use it  
- Privacy behavior  
- Inputs/outputs  
- How it fits into A.B.E.’s chain  
- Constitutional purpose  

Modules live in:
2. **CDI — Constitutional Divergence Index**  
   Measures where practice diverges from that scope: overreach, misuse, ultra vires behavior.

3. **CIRI — Constitutional Integrity ROI Engine**  
   Converts those divergences into **money**:
   - wrongful cases avoided  
   - jail days avoided  
   - unconstitutional fees canceled  
   - employment & income restored  
   - lawsuits and payouts avoided  
   - transition costs accounted for

4. **CIBS — Constitutional Investment & Budget System**  
   Takes the recovery pool and maps it into **public budgets**: housing, health, food, transit, education, etc.

5. **CII — Community Investment Interface**  
   Turns those budgets into **concrete portfolios**:
   - specific projects  
   - costs  
   - people served  
   - jobs created

6. **Integration Layer**  
   Publishes **public-facing KPIs**, integrity checks, and an **audit certificate** so anyone can verify that:
   - the numbers came from the published files  
   - nothing was silently changed  
   - the whole stack is internally consistent

7. **Macro Model**  
   Scales a *single restored community* to 100, 1,000, or 10,000 communities, using conservative multipliers, to show national-scale impact.

Think of it like an **MRI + ledger** for constitutional fidelity:
- It shows where the system is **misaligned**.
- It prices the **harm and the recovery**.
- It shows how to **reinvest the recovery** into real people and communities.

## 2. Why CC BY-NC 4.0 (and why it matters)

This project is licensed under:

> **Creative Commons Attribution–NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0)**

That’s not an aesthetic choice; it’s a **guardrail**:

- A.B.E. is designed to expose **massive, recurring constitutional and economic misalignment**.
- If this engine were purely proprietary and closed, a single actor could:
  - quietly use it,
  - corner the informational advantage,
  - and treat constitutional restoration as a **private arbitrage strategy**.

CC BY-NC draws a hard line:

- ✅ **Yes**:  
  - Governments  
  - Public-interest orgs  
  - Researchers  
  - Communities  
  - Journalists  
  **…can use, adapt, and extend A.B.E. for non-commercial purposes**, with attribution.

- ❌ **No**:  
  - You cannot wrap A.B.E. as a closed SaaS product  
  - You cannot turn it into a monopoly engine to extract rents from the same people it’s meant to protect  
  - You cannot sell it back to the public while hiding the logic

In plain language:

> A.B.E. is meant to break monopolies of information and power — not create a new one.

## 3. Privacy & Data Model

This repo is hosted on **GitHub Pages** (static files only).  
There is **no backend server**, no secret API, no hidden ingestion of your files.

### How CIRI handles your data

On the CIRI page:

- If you use the **built-in `inputs.csv`**, you’re just running the demo scenario that’s stored in this repo.
- If you **upload your own CSV**:
  - The file is read **locally by your browser**.
  - The numbers are computed **locally**.
  - Your file is **never sent to Terra, GitHub, or any server**.
  - You can **download a report** (CSV) you can keep or print for court.

Optionally, CIRI stores a **tiny summary** (no raw file) in your browser’s `localStorage` as:

```text
ABE_CIRI_SCENARIO_V22. **CIBS** — Converts that recovery into transparent, public reinvestment (housing, education, justice, etc.).  
3. **System Map** — Defines and monitors lawful data and fund flow; any deviation is traceable.  
4. **Integration Layer** — Detects tampering, suppression, or retaliation across systems.  
5. **CII (Citizen Impact Index)** — Quantifies local prosperity and social benefit post-alignment.  
6. **Doctrines** — Anchor all metrics in constitutional fidelity and civic ethics.

> The result: a **closed-loop constitutional economy** — measurable, auditable, and incorruptible.

## 🧭 How It Works

1. **CIRI** — Calculates *constitutional economic loss and recovery value* (prevented harm, overreach, or misallocation).  
2. **CIBS** — Converts that recovery into transparent, public reinvestment (housing, education, justice, etc.).  
3. **System Map** — Defines and monitors lawful data and fund flow; any deviation is traceable.  
4. **Integration Layer** — Detects tampering, suppression, or retaliation across systems.  
5. **CII (Citizen Impact Index)** — Quantifies local prosperity and social benefit post-alignment.  
6. **Doctrines** — Anchor all metrics in constitutional fidelity and civic ethics.
