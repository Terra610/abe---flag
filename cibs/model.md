### ðŸ§  Notes
- The formula is modular â€” percentages can shift to meet local needs but must always total **100%**.
- When combined with CIRI, this forms a **transparent economic feedback loop** between justice, recovery, and growth.
- Data can be uploaded from `inputs.csv` or entered manually to simulate local scenarios.
