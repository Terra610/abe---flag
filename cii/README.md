# CII — Community Investment Interface  
**Turning recovery dollars into real projects.**

CII is the bridge between recovered value and boots-on-the-ground improvements.  
It takes the budget categories from CIBS and pairs them with real, auditable project portfolios.

Think:  
Affordable units, clinics, food hubs, transit pilots, credentialing centers — all represented as transparent rows in a CSV.

# 🔥 What This Module Does  
- Loads:
  - `model.json` — categories + multipliers  
  - `portfolio.csv` — project list  
- Performs:
  - category match  
  - multiplier-based estimation  
  - cost formatting  
- Shows:
  - status cards for model/portfolio health  
  - preview table of projects  
  - clean links to Integration Layer  
  - explanation of how dollars become deliverables

# 🔥 Constitutional Purpose  
Rights restoration means nothing if people’s lives don’t improve.

CII ensures that the value recovered from correcting constitutional errors flows into **visible, tangible** community outcomes.  

This beats “policy promises” with a very simple counter-narrative:

> **Show the projects. Show the cost. Show the impact. Make it auditable.**

Everything is open.  
Everything can be checked.  
Nothing is hidden in bureaucracy.

# 🦋 How It Connects  
- CIBS provides category totals  
- CII shows what those totals buy  
- Integration verifies the numbers  
- Macro demonstrates the scaling effect

## Step 2. Match to CIBS Allocations

Each project’s `category` must stay within its corresponding CIBS budget.  
That keeps spending aligned with recovery math, not political discretion.

If your CIBS “Community Housing Support” category totals \$1.3 M,  
the housing projects together should not exceed that pool.

## Step 3. Add Accountability Columns

Optional but recommended fields:

| Column | Purpose |
|---------|----------|
| receipts_posted | Y/N for verified uploads |
| verified_by | Person or agency verifying completion |
| kpi_value | Numeric measure of impact |
| update_timestamp | Last updated date |

These turn your portfolio into a live audit system.

## Step 4. Publish the Dashboard

The `/cii/index.html` page renders these metrics as:
- total projects  
- total dollars active  
- households reached  
- percent verified  

Transparency by design.

## Step 5. Connect to Integration Layer

CII → Integration → MACRO  
That path completes the loop from math → proof → public benefit.

## Why CII Exists

Because integrity is only real when it reaches people.  
CII proves recovery isn’t theoretical — it’s physical, visible, and documented.
