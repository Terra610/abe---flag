# CII — Constitutional Integrity Index

CII converts A.B.E. math into mission.  
It’s where recovery dollars turn into real projects, verified progress, and public trust.

## Step 1. Load the Portfolio

Open `cii/portfolio.csv`.  
Each row is a project derived from your CIBS allocations.

| name | category | cost_usd | households | status |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| 12-unit infill apartments | housing | 2400000 | 12 | scoping |
| Community clinic buildout | health | 1800000 | 350 | design |
| Regional food hub | food | 950000 | 900 | pre-award |
| Adult credentialing center | education | 650000 | 220 | active |
| Transit micro-mobility pilot | transport | 400000 | 1500 | active |

---

## Step 2. Match to CIBS Allocations

Each project’s `category` must stay within its corresponding CIBS budget.  
That keeps spending aligned with recovery math, not political discretion.

If your CIBS “Community Housing Support” category totals \$1.3 M,  
the housing projects together should not exceed that pool.

## Step 3. Add Accountability Columns

Optional but recommended fields:

| Column | Purpose |
|---------|----------|
| receipts_posted | Y/N for verified uploads |
| verified_by | Person or agency verifying completion |
| kpi_value | Numeric measure of impact |
| update_timestamp | Last updated date |

These turn your portfolio into a live audit system.

## Step 4. Publish the Dashboard

The `/cii/index.html` page renders these metrics as:
- total projects  
- total dollars active  
- households reached  
- percent verified  

Transparency by design.

## Step 5. Connect to Integration Layer

CII → Integration → MACRO  
That path completes the loop from math → proof → public benefit.

## Why CII Exists

Because integrity is only real when it reaches people.  
CII proves recovery isn’t theoretical — it’s physical, visible, and documented.
