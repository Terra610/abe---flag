Abstract
The United States Constitution is widely understood as the suprema lex terrae—the supreme law of the land.¹ Less appreciated is its role as an economic constitution, designed to ensure stability, prosperity, and sustainability. This Article argues that deviations from constitutional fidelity constitute not only legal violations but also prima facie economic sabotage.² By tolerating governmental overreach, judicially-created doctrines void ab initio,³ and systemic misuse of federal funds, the United States has undermined the prosperity its constitutional framework was designed to guarantee. A return to strict fidelity—through structural reforms like the American Butterfly Effect (ABE) and Civil Rights Restoration Act (CRRA)—offers both a legal and economic path to renewal.

I. Introduction
The Constitution begins with “We the People,” affirming that sovereignty originates not in the federal or state governments but in the citizenry.⁴ Both state and federal governments are artificial corporate entities, endowed with limited powers derived solely from constitutional delegation.⁵ As Chief Justice Marshall observed, “the government of the Union…is, emphatically and truly, a government of the people.”⁶

Over time, however, both federal and state governments have exceeded their constitutional boundaries, often cloaking overreach in vague doctrines or fabricated necessity. Judicial creations such as Qualified Immunity (QI), which lack any textual or historical basis in the Constitution,⁷ operate ultra vires and enable systemic violations of individual rights.⁸ Similarly, misuse of federal funds by states—whether through misapplication of Medicaid allocations, transportation funds, or housing grants—constitutes fraus legis and undermines the People’s welfare.

The consequences of these deviations are profound. Essentials of life such as housing, healthcare, education, transportation, and access to justice have been monopolized and profitized, leaving millions of citizens without the means to flourish.⁹ Meanwhile, military spending and enforcement budgets expand unchecked, redirecting funds away from the very people government was created to serve. The Constitution is not only a charter of liberty—it is an economic blueprint for national prosperity. To deviate from it is not only unlawful but economically destructive.

This Article advances three central claims:
1. The Constitution is an economic constitution as much as it is a political one.
2. Deviations from constitutional fidelity are prima facie violations that also constitute economic sabotage.
3. Restoring fidelity through frameworks like ABE/CRRA is necessary for both constitutional integrity and sustainable prosperity.

II. The Constitution as Economic Charter
