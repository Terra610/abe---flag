    <h2>Title: Constitutional Fidelity as Economic Security: Re-centering America on Its Supreme Law</h2>
    <p><strong>Author:</strong> Terra Shouse<br>

    </p>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      The United States Constitution is widely understood as the <em>suprema lex terrae</em>—the supreme law of the land.<sup>1</sup>
      Less appreciated is its role as an economic constitution, designed to ensure stability, prosperity, and sustainability.
      This Article argues that deviations from constitutional fidelity constitute not only legal violations but also
      <em>prima facie</em> economic sabotage.<sup>2</sup> By tolerating governmental overreach, judicially-created doctrines
      <em>void ab initio</em>,<sup>3</sup> and systemic misuse of federal funds, the United States has undermined the prosperity
      its constitutional framework was designed to guarantee. A return to strict fidelity—through structural reforms like the
      American Butterfly Effect (ABE) and Civil Rights Restoration Act (CRRA)—offers both a legal and economic path to renewal.
    </p>

    <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The Constitution begins with “We the People,” affirming that sovereignty originates not in the federal or state
      governments but in the citizenry.<sup>4</sup> Both state and federal governments are artificial corporate entities,
      endowed with limited powers derived solely from constitutional delegation.<sup>5</sup> As Chief Justice Marshall
      observed, “the government of the Union…is, emphatically and truly, a government of the people.”<sup>6</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, however, both federal and state governments have exceeded their constitutional boundaries, often cloaking
      overreach in vague doctrines or fabricated necessity. Judicial creations such as Qualified Immunity (QI), which lack
      any textual or historical basis in the Constitution,<sup>7</sup> operate <em>ultra vires</em> and enable systemic
      violations of individual rights.<sup>8</sup> Similarly, misuse of federal funds by states—whether through misapplication
      of Medicaid allocations, transportation funds, or housing grants—constitutes <em>fraus legis</em> and undermines the
      People’s welfare.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consequences of these deviations are profound. Essentials of life such as housing, healthcare, education,
      transportation, and access to justice have been monopolized and profitized, leaving millions of citizens without the
      means to flourish.<sup>9</sup> Meanwhile, military spending and enforcement budgets expand unchecked, redirecting funds
      away from the very people government was created to serve. The Constitution is not only a charter of liberty—it is an
      economic blueprint for national prosperity. To deviate from it is not only unlawful but economically destructive.
    </p>
    <p>This Article advances three central claims:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The Constitution is an economic constitution as much as it is a political one.</li>
      <li>Deviations from constitutional fidelity are <em>prima facie</em> violations that also constitute economic sabotage.</li>
      <li>Restoring fidelity through frameworks like ABE/CRRA is necessary for both constitutional integrity and sustainable prosperity.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>II. The Constitution as Economic Charter</h2>
    <p>
      The Constitution is more than a political framework; it is an economic constitution. Its provisions—particularly those
      concerning commerce, postal infrastructure, coinage, bankruptcy, and contracts—form the blueprint for prosperity and
      stability. Any deviation from these provisions is not merely unlawful but constitutes <em>fraus legis</em> and results
      in economic distortion.
    </p>

    <h3>A. The Commerce Clause</h3>
    <p>
      The Commerce Clause grants Congress the power “[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several
      States, and with the Indian Tribes.”<sup>II-1</sup> This clause has long been recognized as a cornerstone of national
      unity, preventing interstate trade wars and establishing a uniform economic order.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chief Justice Marshall, in <em>Gibbons v. Ogden</em>,<sup>II-2</sup> defined “commerce” broadly to include navigation,
      confirming Congress’s supremacy in regulating interstate trade. Yet, this power has limits. In <em>United States v.
      Lopez</em>,<sup>II-3</sup> the Court struck down the Gun-Free School Zones Act, holding that mere possession of a
      firearm in a local school zone bore no substantial relation to interstate commerce. Similarly, in <em>United States v.
      Morrison</em>,<sup>II-4</sup> the Court invalidated provisions of the Violence Against Women Act, rejecting attempts to
      stretch commerce to cover non-economic violent crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      By contrast, in <em>Wickard v. Filburn</em>,<sup>II-5</sup> the Court upheld regulation of wheat grown for personal
      consumption on the theory that, in aggregate, such conduct affected interstate commerce. While expansive, <em>Wickard</em>
      underscores the danger of conflating private, personal activities with commerce. The principle of
      <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius</em> dictates that Congress’s enumerated power to regulate commerce does not
      extend to regulating citizens themselves when acting outside of commerce. Treating private conduct as commerce is
      <em>ultra vires</em> and <em>void ab initio</em>.
    </p>

    <h3>B. The Postal Clause</h3>
    <p>
      The Postal Clause empowers Congress “[t]o establish Post Offices and post Roads.”<sup>II-6</sup> Far from being a minor
      administrative provision, this clause laid the foundation for the nation’s commercial infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <em>Ex parte Jackson</em>,<sup>II-7</sup> the Court affirmed Congress’s plenary authority over the postal system,
      noting its centrality to national commerce. Postal routes became the backbone of interstate exchange, later evolving
      into railroads, highways, and shipping channels. The continuity of commerce—foreign and domestic—rests on this
      infrastructure. Interference with or underfunding of USPS operations disrupts the constitutional blueprint for
      commerce itself and amounts to <em>fraus legis</em>.
    </p>

    <h3>C. Coinage, Bankruptcy, Contracts Clauses</h3>
    <p>
      The framers, informed by the economic chaos under the Articles of Confederation, recognized that a stable and predictable
      economic system was essential to liberty. The Coinage Clause grants Congress the exclusive power “[t]o coin Money,
      regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin.”<sup>II-8</sup> The Bankruptcy Clause authorizes uniform federal
      bankruptcy laws.<sup>II-9</sup> The Contracts Clause prevents states from impairing contracts.<sup>II-11</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Sturges v. Crowninshield</em><sup>II-10</sup> reaffirmed federal supremacy in bankruptcy; <em>Home Building &amp;
      Loan Ass’n v. Blaisdell</em><sup>II-12</sup> allowed temporary relief during emergency but preserved the Clause’s core
      purpose. Together, these provisions form a self-healing system of economic fidelity: stable currency, uniform bankruptcy,
      and enforceable contracts create the conditions for prosperity.
    </p>

    <h2>III. The Tenth Amendment and the Myth of Broad Police Power</h2>

    <h3>A. Text &amp; Original Intent</h3>
    <blockquote>
      “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved
      to the States respectively, or to the people.”<sup>III-1</sup>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This is a rule of reservation, not of expansion.<sup>III-2</sup> Madison emphasized the balance: federal powers are
      “few and defined,” state powers “numerous and indefinite,”<sup>III-3</sup> but neither are unbounded, and both are
      subordinate to the Constitution and federal supremacy.
    </p>

    <h3>B. Misuse of Police Power Doctrine</h3>
    <p>
      The so-called “police power” has been stretched far beyond its historical meaning. <em>Slaughter-House Cases</em>
      cautioned that states’ local regulatory power is circumscribed by federal rights.<sup>III-4</sup> Regulating a private
      citizen acting outside commerce—e.g., a person using a personal car for private travel—as if they were engaged in
      commerce is <em>ultra vires</em> and <em>void ab initio</em>.
    </p>

    <h3>C. Right to Travel &amp; Private Activity</h3>
    <p>
      The right to travel is fundamental. <em>Shapiro v. Thompson</em><sup>III-5</sup> and <em>Saenz v. Roe</em><sup>III-6</sup>
      invalidate penalties on movement. Treating private, non-commercial travel as a licensable commercial privilege is
      <em>fraus legis</em>.
    </p>

    <h2>IV. Supremacy Clause and Hierarchy of Sovereignty</h2>

    <h3>A. Constitutional Hierarchy</h3>
    <blockquote>
      “This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof…shall be the supreme
      Law of the Land…”<sup>IV-1</sup>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Hamilton articulated supremacy in <em>The Federalist No. 33</em>.<sup>IV-2</sup> <em>Marbury</em><sup>IV-3</sup> declared
      unconstitutional laws void; <em>McCulloch</em><sup>IV-4</sup> barred states from obstructing legitimate federal functions.
    </p>

    <h3>B. States Cannot Nullify Federal Rights</h3>
    <p>
      <em>Cooper v. Aaron</em><sup>IV-5, IV-6</sup> held states bound by the Court’s constitutional interpretations. Conflicting
      state laws are <em>void ab initio</em>.
    </p>

    <h3>C. The People as Final Sovereigns</h3>
    <p>
      “We the People” anchors ultimate sovereignty in citizens.<sup>IV-7</sup> The Tenth Amendment reserves undelegated powers
      “to the…people.”<sup>IV-8</sup> Government is a fiduciary trust (Locke),<sup>IV-9</sup> and <em>ultra vires</em> acts
      lack legitimacy.
    </p>

    <h2>V. Consequences of Constitutional Deviation</h2>

    <h3>A. Economic Monopolization</h3>
    <p>
      Monopolization of essentials (healthcare, housing, education, transport, justice) reduces citizens to dependency.
      <em>Lochner</em><sup>V-1</sup> (controversial) still underscores that economic liberty intertwines with constitutional
      guarantees. <em>Northern Securities</em><sup>V-2</sup> fought concentrated power; when government enables monopoly over
      essentials, it abandons its fiduciary duty.
    </p>

    <h3>B. Judicial Invention of Doctrines</h3>
    <p>
      Qualified Immunity—created in <em>Harlow</em><sup>V-3</sup>—has no constitutional basis; see Baude’s critique.<sup>V-4</sup>
      Chevron deference<sup>V-5</sup> shifts interpretive power to agencies, diluting separation of powers. Such devices are
      <em>ultra vires</em>, <em>void ab initio</em>, and <em>fraus legis</em> when they thwart remedies and accountability.
    </p>

    <h3>C. Misallocation of Federal Funds (<em>Fraus Legis</em>)</h3>
    <p>
      Systemic diversion or underfunding of Medicaid, housing, transportation, and education alongside outsized military/
      enforcement budgets defies statutory purposes. <em>Train v. City of New York</em><sup>V-6</sup> bars executive withholding
      of appropriated funds; misallocation is economic sabotage.
    </p>

    <h3>D. Structural Effects</h3>
    <p>
      The cumulative result is national decline—rising costs, reduced justice access, and diminished liberty. As Justice
      Sutherland wrote in <em>Carter Coal</em>, “commerce is intercourse for the purposes of trade.”<sup>V-7</sup> Mistaking
      citizens for commerce collapses the constitutional economy.
    </p>

    <h2>VI. Case Studies</h2>

    <h3>A. Domestic Troop Deployment</h3>
    <p>
      The Posse Comitatus Act restricts military in civilian law enforcement absent express authorization.<sup>VI-1</sup>
      The Insurrection Act requires actual insurrection/obstruction.<sup>VI-2</sup> <em>Youngstown</em><sup>VI-3</sup> limits
      executive action without Congress. Unilateral domestic deployment is <em>ultra vires</em>, conflicts with oaths under
      5 U.S.C. § 3331, and risks illegality.
    </p>

    <h3>B. Healthcare &amp; Big Pharma</h3>
    <p>
      Public funds should serve the general Welfare.<sup>VI-4</sup> <em>Actavis</em><sup>VI-5</sup> scrutinized “pay-for-delay”
      schemes; tolerating monopolistic pricing while underfunding public health is <em>fraus legis</em> and contrary to Due
      Process/Equal Protection.
    </p>

    <h3>C. Transportation &amp; Licensing</h3>
    <p>
      Treating every driver as a commercial actor collapses the liberty/commerce distinction. <em>Saenz</em><sup>VI-6</sup>
      and <em>Slaughter-House</em><sup>VI-7</sup> reinforce limits: private, non-commercial travel is not “commerce among the
      several States.”
    </p>

    <h3>D. Structural Parallels</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Government exceeds enumerated authority;</li>
      <li>Judiciary legitimizes deviation via invention or deference;</li>
      <li>Citizens absorb economic/liberty harms.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>VII. The ABE/CRRA Framework as Remedy</h2>

    <h3>A. Principles</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Fidelity to constitutional text and existing statutes (<em>suprema lex terrae</em>).</li>
      <li>Restoration, not expansion, of power.</li>
      <li>Economic security through citizen investment.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>B. Legal Basis</h3>
    <h4>1. Constitutional Foundations</h4>
    <p>
      The Preamble’s general Welfare and the Spending Clause authorize Congress to allocate for the common good.<sup>VII-1, VII-2</sup>
      From <em>Butler</em><sup>VII-3</sup> to <em>Dole</em><sup>VII-4</sup>, courts affirm broad spending discretion; redirecting
      funds from coercion to citizens is both permissible and imperative.
    </p>
    <h4>2. Statutory Compatibility</h4>
    <p>
      Existing law (e.g., the CRA)<sup>VII-5</sup> and fiscal accountability statutes (e.g., False Claims Act)<sup>VII-6</sup>
      support reclaiming misused funds and reinvesting constitutionally.
    </p>

    <h3>C. Reparations as Constitutional Fidelity</h3>
    <p>
      CRRA’s reparations model addresses harms from overreach (incarceration, discriminatory housing, disenfranchisement) and
      fulfills Due Process and Equal Protection. As <em>Brown</em><sup>VII-7</sup> teaches, systemic harm demands systemic remedy.
    </p>

    <h3>D. Self-Healing Through Economic Blueprint</h3>
    <p>
      Redirected funds create a feedback loop: disparities shrink → productivity rises → reliance falls. This is
      <em>aequitas sequitur legem</em>—equity follows the law.
    </p>

    <h2>VIII. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The Constitution is both supreme law and economic blueprint. Deviations—monopoly, invented doctrines, fiscal
      misallocation, executive overreach—breed inequality and decline. But fidelity provides a lawful path to renewal.
      ABE/CRRA realigns resources with constitutional purposes, restoring prosperity and trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Supremacy Clause subordinates governments to the Constitution; the Preamble anchors sovereignty in the People.
      Governments are corporations, holding only delegated powers. <em>Ultra vires</em> acts are <em>void ab initio</em>. As
      Justice Jackson cautioned in <em>Youngstown</em>, the Constitution is neither a suicide pact nor a blank check.<sup>VIII-1</sup>
      It is a blueprint. To follow it is to flourish; to abandon it is to perish. It is time to set the nation back on the
      right path.
