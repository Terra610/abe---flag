  <h1>A.B.E. Doctrine</h1>
  <p>Foundational legal and ethical principles behind the American Butterfly Effect.</p>
</header>

<main>

  <section>
    <h2>1. A.B.E. ‚Äî American Butterfly Effect</h2>
    <p>
      A.B.E. is the full framework. It says:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>When the state violates you, that‚Äôs not ‚Äúunfortunate.‚Äù It‚Äôs economic damage.</li>
      <li>When that violation is stopped, the savings and restored productivity are measurable in dollars.</li>
      <li>Those dollars belong back in the community harmed, not in the same system that did the harm.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A.B.E. operationalizes this through four modules you can inspect:
      <a href="../ciri/index.html">CIRI (calculate harm avoided)</a>,
      <a href="../cibs/index.html">CIBS (allocate repair)</a>,
      <a href="../system/index.html">System Map (ledger)</a>,
      <a href="../integration/index.html">Integration Layer (tamper alarm)</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      A.B.E. is not charity. A.B.E. is obligation accounting.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. CRRA ‚Äî Civil Rights Recovery Accounting</h2>
    <p>
      CRRA is the accounting stance underneath CIRI and CIBS.
      It treats civil rights violations like financial liabilities, not PR problems.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If a wrongful arrest would have cost $75,000 in settlement, preventing that arrest is not ‚Äúnice,‚Äù it is $75,000 in public risk avoided.</li>
      <li>If 3,800 jail-days didn‚Äôt happen because predatory charges were dropped, that is direct taxpayer savings.</li>
      <li>If a suspended license was restored and that person can legally work again, that future income is recoverable economic value, not ‚Äúanecdote.‚Äù</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      CRRA says: document those dollars, total them, and mark them as a Recovery Pool that belongs to the harmed population.
      That Recovery Pool is what CIBS allocates.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      CRRA answers the excuse ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt afford reform‚Äù by proving: you already paid for the harm, plus interest.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Constitutional Fidelity</h2>
    <p>
      Constitutional fidelity is the position that government power is only lawful when it is exercised within constitutional bounds.
      When state actors step outside those bounds, what they are doing is not ‚Äúpolicy,‚Äù it‚Äôs unlawful conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this model:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Constitutional compliance is not optional behavior ‚Äî it‚Äôs the floor.</li>
      <li>Budgets and policies are illegitimate if they depend on violating rights to function.</li>
      <li>Stopping a violation isn‚Äôt ‚Äúreform,‚Äù it‚Äôs restoration of lawful status.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      That matters financially. If your jail, court, or revenue structure depends on behavior that would not survive constitutional scrutiny, that portion of your budget is illegitimate.
      A.B.E. surfaces that.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      This is why CIRI isn‚Äôt just math ‚Äî it‚Äôs compliance math.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Void ab initio</h2>
    <p>
      ‚ÄúVoid ab initio‚Äù means ‚Äúinvalid from the beginning.‚Äù
      Under this doctrine, if an act, policy, arrest, detention, fine, fee, seizure, or coercive demand was unconstitutional, it was never legally valid in the first place.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You don‚Äôt get to keep money you took using an authority you never actually had.</li>
      <li>You don‚Äôt get to keep a conviction built on a process that violated due process.</li>
      <li>You don‚Äôt get to claim ‚Äúthat‚Äôs in the past‚Äù when the underlying act was void the moment it was done.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Operationally in A.B.E., ‚Äúvoid ab initio‚Äù justifies:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Immediate case dismissal / record clearing.</li>
      <li>Immediate fee/penalty cancellation.</li>
      <li>Direct financial redirection back to the harmed party‚Äôs community.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">
      Translation: if it was unconstitutional, it‚Äôs not just ‚Äúbad optics,‚Äù it is not legally collectible. You owe it back.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Where this doctrine connects to enforcement</h2>
    <p>
      These principles are not academic.
      They are wired into the math and the budget flow:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>CIRI</strong> uses CRRA logic to total financial impact of compliance.</li>
      <li><strong>CIBS</strong> takes that total and assigns obligation lines instead of letting governments bury it.</li>
      <li><strong>System Map</strong> makes that obligation public and diffable (see <a href="../system/map.json"><code>system/map.json</code></a>).</li>
      <li><strong>Integration Layer</strong> is the escalation path when someone tries to hide, retaliate, or erase.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is how communities, attorneys, and auditors can say:
      <em>‚ÄúThe harm was unlawful. The value is calculated. The reinvestment is mapped. If you steal it, we can prove it.‚Äù</em>
    </p>
