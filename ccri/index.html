      <h2>What CCRI Does</h2>
      <p>
        CCRI evaluates how lenders, dealers, and underwriters use data when deciding who gets access to
        credit and vehicles. It flags when:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>DMV or DOT data is used for non–DOT-regulated citizens.</li>
        <li>License status or traffic enforcement is treated as a gatekeeper for basic economic mobility.</li>
        <li>State-created barriers are silently driving private credit decisions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        CCRI never scores people. It scores the <strong>systems</strong> and <strong>rules</strong>
        that stand between people and lawful access to credit, transportation, and work.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Inputs</h2>
      <p>
        CCRI reads scenarios defined in <code>ccri/inputs.json</code>. Each scenario represents a specific lender,
        dealership, or underwriting policy set and describes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Which data sources are used (credit bureaus, DMV, DOT, background vendors).</li>
        <li>Whether license status is required to apply, test drive, or fund a loan.</li>
        <li>How many applicants are denied based on DMV or license-related criteria.</li>
        <li>Whether there is any appeal or human review path.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The engine then calls the shared A.B.E. constitutional layer to determine where those practices diverge
        from federal law and the Constitution.

      <h2>Outputs & Linkage</h2>
      <p>
        CCRI produces scores and metrics that are consumed by other A.B.E. modules:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>CIRI</strong>: rights and enforcement divergence tied to credit and mobility barriers.</li>
        <li><strong>CFF</strong>: financial exposure where unlawful data is embedded in underwriting models.</li>
        <li><strong>CIBS</strong>: how many households and how much GDP can be unlocked by correcting the rules.</li>
        <li><strong>AFFE</strong>: long-term stability, default reductions, and community-level recovery.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Together, these modules show how correcting credit and lending practices can restore both
        constitutional fidelity and economic opportunity.
