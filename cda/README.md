## 🌟 What CDA Does  

CDA is the module that tells you, in structured form:

> **“Where does real-world enforcement depart from controlling federal law and the Constitution?”**

Where CAE provides the **legal scope** and CDI gives the **numeric signal**,  
**CDA is the bridge**: it transforms *events, practices, and policies* into  
**machine-readable divergence flags**.

CDA answers questions like:

- Was this stop within the officer’s actual statutory authority?  
- Does this state requirement conflict with federal preemption?  
- Did the enforcement action treat a non-commercial citizen as if they were DOT-regulated?  
- Is a state funding condition drifting off-mission from what Congress actually authorized?  
- Does this policy create constitutional risk that later shows up in CIRI?

CDA does *not* determine guilt or innocence.  
It maps the **observed practice** to its place in the **constitutional hierarchy**.

## 📂 What CDA Takes In  

CDA reads scenarios generated by you or by **Intake**:

- Enforcement events (traffic stops, detentions, fines)  
- Policy decisions (licensing rules, administrative denials)  
- Funding triggers (conditions tied to grants)  
- Credit-related gating rules (passed in from CCRI)  
- Any structured JSON describing what actually happened  

Each scenario may include:

- Jurisdiction  
- Officer / agency authority claimed  
- Statutes invoked  
- Federal law references  
- Enforcement actions taken  
- Outcomes (detention, charges, denial, seizure, etc.)

CDA then evaluates those statements **against the controlling legal framework** supplied by CAE.

## 📘 What CDA Produces  

Each CDA scenario yields:

1. **A divergence score (0–1)**  
   - `0` = fully aligned with constitutional + statutory authority  
   - `1` = maximally divergent from controlling law  

2. **A structured explanation** broken into:  
   - Authority alignment  
   - Federal preemption  
   - Commercial vs. non-commercial status  
   - Constitutional boundaries (due process, equal protection, etc.)  
   - Statutory drift indicators  
   - Funding mission compliance (if applicable)  

3. **Flags**, such as:  
   - `ultra_vires_stop`  
   - `preemption_violation`  
   - `misapplied_commercial_code`  
   - `off_mission_enforcement`  
   - `constitutional_risk_high`  

4. **A machine-readable JSON output** consumed directly by:  
   - **CDI** (to compute divergence index)  
   - **CIRI** (economic harm model)  
   - **CFF** (funding misuse analysis)  
   - **AFFE** (alignment pathways)  
   - **Integration** (hash + receipt layer)

Nothing in CDA is legal advice.  
It is an **alignment engine**, not a lawyer.

## 🔗 How CDA Fits Into the Pipeline  

> **Intake → CDA → CDI → CIRI → CIBS → CII → Integration**

- **Intake** extracts facts from tickets, orders, memos, contracts  
- **CDA** maps those facts onto the hierarchy of law  
- **CDI** turns divergence into a 0–1 signal  
- **CIRI** quantifies economic harm + recovery  
- **CFF / AFFE** track funding and alignment patterns  
- **Integration** applies SHA-256 and generates a local audit receipt

Without CDA, the engine knows **numbers** but not **why the drift happened**.  
CDA provides the “why”.

## 📑 Schema & Model  

- **`cda/schema.json`** defines the CDA scenario format:  
  - Required fields  
  - Enforcement descriptors  
  - Preemption markers  
  - Output structure  
  - Hashing fields for integrity  

- **`cda/model.json`** defines the scoring logic:  
  - Divergence dimensions (authority, preemption, constitutional boundaries, funding alignment)  
  - Severity weights  
  - Flag rules  
  - Thresholds for low / medium / high risk  
  - Narrative templates for human-readable explanations  

This makes CDA **deterministic and reproducible** — the same inputs always produce the same outputs.

---

## 🛡️ Privacy & Local-Only Processing  

CDA follows the same privacy rules as the rest of A.B.E.:

- 100% client-side  
- No servers, no logins, no tracking  
- No uploads stored anywhere  
- SHA-256 hashes for artifacts you choose to keep  

Your data never leaves your device unless **you** decide to share a CDA artifact.

## 🧬 Philosophical Core  

CDA exists for one purpose:

> **To expose, in structured form, where reality has drifted from the Constitution —  
> because fidelity is how communities recover.**
